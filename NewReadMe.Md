What went Awesome?
> Using GridItemsLayout Orientation as Vertical with Span 2 was surprisingly awesome. :)

What didn't go well?
I have been working on zizzag collection View and there should be another way we can do to replicate Pinterest UI's using Collection View

How is the performance?
It's awesome
